Proposed Endeavor: Advancing Data-Driven Modernization Across U.S. Healthcare, Finance, and Industrial Ecosystems

I propose to advance the modernization of data engineering and analytics infrastructure across the U.S. healthcare, finance, insurance, supply chain, and e-commerce sectors. My work focuses on building interoperable, secure, and scalable data systems that drive national priorities of transparency, efficiency, and digital transformation. Through modern cloud-native architectures—leveraging tools such as AWS Glue, Databricks, Snowflake, Azure Synapse, and dbt—I develop reproducible frameworks that improve how critical data is ingested, governed, and analyzed at scale.

Problem Context

Many U.S. industries face a common structural challenge: fragmented data silos that prevent timely insights, waste resources, and increase risk.
In healthcare, outdated data systems hinder Medicaid oversight, clinical research, and fraud prevention.
In finance and insurance, disconnected data architectures delay risk assessment and compliance reporting.
In supply chain and e-commerce, lack of unified visibility contributes to inefficiencies, stockouts, and lost revenue.
These gaps directly affect national resilience, economic performance, and public trust in data-driven decision-making.

Proposed Solution and Methodology

My endeavor is to design and deploy scalable “data-modernization blueprints” that unify ingestion, governance, and analytics through automated, cloud-based pipelines.
Key components include:
	•	Change-Data-Capture (CDC) ingestion from legacy systems using AWS DMS and Debezium.
	•	Data Lakehouse architecture (Bronze–Silver–Gold) implemented via Glue, Databricks, or Azure Synapse.
	•	Automated transformations and lineage tracking using dbt and Great Expectations.
	•	Governance and compliance layers aligned with HIPAA, FHIR, and SOC-2 frameworks.

By integrating these components, I enable organizations to move from static batch processing to real-time, audit-ready analytics—supporting better policy, operational, and financial decisions.

National Benefit

This work directly supports U.S. national interests by:
	•	Reducing healthcare and insurance fraud through intelligent claims integrity analytics.
	•	Improving fiscal and pricing transparency across financial and commercial ecosystems.
	•	Strengthening domestic supply chain resilience and industrial analytics capabilities.
	•	Enabling e-commerce platforms to operate securely and ethically using consumer-centric data frameworks.

By publishing technical blogs, sharing reproducible architectures, and mentoring data professionals, I aim to build open knowledge resources that elevate U.S. leadership in applied data engineering and public-benefit analytics.

Personal Positioning and Long-Term Vision

With over a decade of experience in data engineering and analytics, dual master’s degrees from Boston University, and certifications including PMP® and Microsoft Azure Data Engineer (DP-203), I am uniquely positioned to advance this mission.
My published projects on pawanjadhav.cloud￼ and GitHub demonstrate successful implementations of healthcare interoperability, pricing analytics, and data-governance frameworks adaptable to multiple industries.
Over the next decade, I intend to continue developing, documenting, and disseminating scalable data solutions that strengthen America’s digital economy and governance infrastructure.
